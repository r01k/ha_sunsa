# Sunsa Smart Blinds Wand Integration
![](https://github.com/r01k/ha_sunsa/blob/master/assets/branding/logo%402x.png)

Monitor and control your Sunsa blinds wands from Home Assistant.

- Control the position of the blinds.
- Monitor the wands battery level.
- Monitor other wand sensors.
- See wands diagnostic info.

This custom Home Assistant component integrates the 
[Sunsa Smart Blinds Wands](https://sunsawands.com/) by leveraging the public Sunsa REST 
cloud API. All the wands in your Sunsa account will be added to Home Assistant as cover 
entities of type blind.


## Prerequisites
---
In order to use the Sunsa cloud API you need to activate it for your account:
1. Inside the Sunsa app, go to `Setttings` > `API Settings`  and turn on the toggle.
2. Take note of your  `API Key` and `User ID`.


## Installation
---
### HACS
The recommended method to install this integration is through the
[Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/):

1. Inside HACS, go to `Integrations` > Click the three-dot overflow menu `â‹®` on the upper 
right and click `Custom repositories`.
2. In the `Custom repositories` dialog add the repository URL 
https://github.com/r01k/ha_sunsa. For `Category` select `Integration`.
3. Click `ADD`.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Go to the `Integrations` page and add the `Sunsa` integration following the 
configuration wizard. You'll need three pieces of information:
	- Your Sunsa account email. (This is only used in the integration to group the devices
   and not for authentication).
	- Your Sunsa API User ID. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
	- Your Sunsa API Key. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

### Manual Installation
---
Alternatively, you can install the integration manually (advanced). You don't need HACS to
do this but then managing 
integration updates must be done manually too.
1. Download the `sunsa` folder in the Master branch of the GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/r01k/ha_sunsa/tree/master/custom_components/sunsa.
2. Copy the `sunsa` folder to the `custom_components` folder in your Home Assistant 
system.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Continue on step 5 under [HACS](#hacs).

## FAQ
---
- *I added/deleted new wands. How do I update Home Assistant?*

  If you added new wands, reload the integration for them to be added automatically. 
  If wands were removed from your Sunsa account, they'll be marked unavailable in Home 
  Assistant and you can remove them manually.
- *There is a delay for the wands to move and for Home Assistant to update the status.*

  This is expected as per the polling interval of 20 seconds recommended by Sunsa. The 
  delay should be at most 20 seconds. Note that all cloud-polling integrations present 
  some delay.

## Troubleshooting
---
I developed and tested the integration with several wands of model SUNSA SW1. Correct 
functionality is not guaranteed with different (potentially older) models. In any case, 
open an issue here if you see any problem. Remember to always enable debug logging for the
integration when troubleshooting:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sunsa: debug
```

Enjoy!
